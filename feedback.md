My formative submission was truly a disaster (cry).
For Week3:
For the website establishment, I made a mistake at typing the name of that respository, so the right website didn't exsit.
However, I finished other steps like decorating and adding contents.
For Week4:
Biggest problem for week4 is usage of pseudocode because it hasn't become a habit.
To get a logical and fluent project, it's important to use it.
For week5:
I made a mistake in saving file that exams population questions, so the file doesn't in the right path.
The other project fits the guidance well.
